Hi, I’m Achim Burtscheidt.

I have a PhD in mathematics and I am interested in electronics and hardware programming.

I am currently working on a modular concept for configurable IoT hardware and software for a wide range of applications.

The software framework I am working on is an extension of the Arduino framework. The main goal is to develop an object-oriented, powerful toolset that can be used to create complex IoT firmware without spending too much time on repetitive and monotonous programming tasks. In addition, I aim to achieve greater hardware independence for MCU-related software. To accomplish this, standardized interfaces for many hardware components (such as displays, input devices, RTCs, memory devices, ...) are created, allowing easy integration of external libraries/drivers.

The first version of the framework will be released soon, so stay tuned!
