Hi, I’m Achim Burtscheidt.

I have a PhD in mathematics and I am interested in electronics and hardware programming.

I am currently working on a modular concept for configurable IoT hardware and software for a wide range of applications.

The software framework I am working on is an extension of the Arduino framework. The main goal is to develop an object-oriented, powerful toolset that can be used to create complex IoT firmware without spending too much time on repetitive and monotonous programming tasks.

The first version of the framework will be released soon, so stay tuned!
